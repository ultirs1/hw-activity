# hw-activity

###### TASK 1

Started with creating a new repository on GitHub named hw-activity.

Then cloned the repo locally using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultirs1/hw-activity
```

Once completed I edited the README.md file with some notes and saved it.

This was then committed and pushed to GitHub using:

```bash
git add .
git commit --m "First Update to ReadMe"
git push
```



###### TASK 2

To create a branch from my main branch there were 2 approaches. First was to create one through GitHub and adding a new branch from Main. The other was to utilise:

```bash
git checkout -b ryan
```

To see which branches were available and to switch to the right branch I used:

```bash
git branch
git checkout ryan
```

After updating the ReadMe I then committed and pushed changes to GitHub. 

```bash
git add .
git commit --m "Second Update to ReadMe"
git push
```
